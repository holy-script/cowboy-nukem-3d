## 💡CowBoy Nukem 3D
- A first person shooter (FPS) based in the wild west, similar in gameplay and feel to old classics like Wolfenstein, Duke Nukem and DOOM - plus, it uses   the same raycasting, rendering and pseudo 3D methodologies!

## 🛠️ How we built it
- We used Ray casting which is the methodological basis for 3D CAD/CAM solid modeling and image rendering. Raycasting is a rendering technique to create a   3D perspective in a 2D map. Back when computers were slower it wasn't possible to run real 3D engines in real-time, and raycasting was the first           solution. Raycasting can go very fast because only a calculation has to be done for every vertical line of the screen. The raycasting engine of           Wolfenstein 3D was very limited, allowing it to run on even a 286 computer: all the walls have the same height and are orthogonal squares on a 2D grid,   as can be seen in this screenshot from a map editor for Wolf3D

## ⚠️ Challenges we ran into
- We had problems with interpreting appwrite because appwrite+pygame was never done before and 
  we couldn't find any blogs, docs, or tutorials. The second issue was designing and finding assets for 
  the game.

## 👩‍💼🧑‍💻 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We are proud to make this project functional and working to help gamers in a certain manner.
- We are immensely proud of achieving a good team contribution with each of the members who have n 
   contributed to the project in some way or other.
- We learned many technologies and had experience working on them as well. Such as GitHub and the 
  GitHub pages were something we were introduced to for the first time.

## ⚓ What we learned
We learned a lot about appwrite's Python SDK. We also learned the ray casting algorithms.

## 🤝 What's next for Cowboy Nukem
- We want to have a live leaderboard
- We want to add a Twilio functionality but due to time we couldn't make that happen
- Scaling to hundreds of thousands of users and UX improvements!
- Making the code Open Source and engaging different People.
